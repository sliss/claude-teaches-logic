# Unit 1: Propositional Logic — Notes

## Overview

Propositional logic is the simplest formal logical system. It studies the behavior of logical connectives (and, or, not, implies) without looking inside propositions.

**What you likely know from boolean algebra:** Truth tables, logical equivalences, basic identities (De Morgan's laws, distributivity, etc.)

**What's new:** Viewing this as a *formal system* with syntax, semantics, and proof theory. The meta-questions: What does it mean for an argument to be valid? What's the relationship between truth and provability?
