## Open Questions / Deferred Topics

Things that came up but were intentionally postponed:

1. **Philosophy of axioms** — Are axioms "arbitrary"? Constrained vs. determined. (Revisit after Unit 8)
2. **The Gödel diagram** — True vs. provable visualization. (Revisit after Unit 5-6)
3. **Gödel and metalanguage** — If incompleteness theorems are proved in metalanguage, is the metalanguage itself an object language? (Good insight; revisit in Unit 8)
4. **Curry-Howard correspondence** — Deep connection between proofs and programs. Mentioned briefly; could explore more if interested.

## Milestones

- [ ] Complete Unit 1 (Propositional Logic)
- [ ] Complete Unit 3 (FOL Semantics) — can now read logic notation fluently
- [ ] Complete Unit 5 (Completeness) — understand the "true in all models" concept
- [ ] Revisit Gödel diagram — should click now
- [ ] Complete Unit 8 (Incompleteness) — course complete

## Notes on Learning

- Web app working well for lesson delivery and exercises
- Steven catches implicit assumptions — lesson materials improved based on feedback (explicit object/meta variable convention)
- CS analogies (programming languages, currying) are effective bridges
- Tangents into Gödel territory are productive but correctly deferred until foundations are in place
- Good intuition check: asked if → is like =, which led to productive discussion of conditional vs biconditional
- Framing → as "just !p || q" clicked well — building on boolean algebra foundation
